This is the front-end portion of NoctJournal, a short-form journalling web app designed and built over the course of 9 days as a final project by a team of 3 students (@bashunaimiroy, @tzulkarnain and @scharfsilentc) in the DecodeMTL Web Developer Bootcamp.

The front-end portion consists of a React app using 20~ components and an API wrapper which communicates with the back-end, currently deployed at https://glacial-dawn-27724.herokuapp.com/.

Modules used in the front-end include React Router DOM, React Chart.js 2, Firebase, Superagent, Moment and Google Map React.

CSS Grid and Styled Components were used extensively in the design of the user interface, as well as elements of Semantic UI.

Deployment is coming soon. For now, you can test the app in your browser by cloning this repo, running npm install and npm start. We hope you enjoy it.
